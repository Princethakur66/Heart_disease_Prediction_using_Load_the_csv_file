## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project presents a Heart Disease Prediction System developed using three prominent machine learning algorithms:

**Support Vector Machine (SVM)** â€“ **Accuracy: 81.05%**

**Random Forest Classifier** â€“ **Accuracy: 90.05%**

**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** â€“ **Accuracy: 67.05%**

The system takes patient medical data as input and predicts the likelihood of heart disease. By leveraging different algorithms, we compare their effectiveness in making accurate predictions and identify the most reliable model for real-world applications.
